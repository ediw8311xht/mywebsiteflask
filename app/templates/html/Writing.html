<h3 class="writing-title">Matthew 10:34-39</h3>
<ul id="home-most-important">
  <li>[34] Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.</li>
  <li>[35] For I have come to set a man against his father, and a daughter against her mother, and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law.</li>
  <li>[36] And a person's enemies will be those of his own household.</li>
  <li>[37] Whoever loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me, and whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me.</li>
  <li>[38] And whoever does not take his cross and follow me is not worthy of me.</li>
  <li>[39] Whoever finds his life will lose it, and whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.</li></ul>
