<h1>Windows is Retarded</h1>

<p>
Windows has set back the modern desktop more than any other piece of software has.
</p>

<p>
Not only is the drag and drop desktop type window system so fucking stupid, it is also not even done correctly when compared to Plasma or XFCE (fuck gnome).
</p>

<p>
Windows 7 was the last Windows OS with a real start button, but still sucked. If you wanted to modify settings of your os you had to use regedit or 
find some weird obscure folder with a directory system that made no sense compared to unix based operating systems. Tons of different settings you could not modify, 
the firewall sucked and trying to harden Windows 7 is significantly more difficult than any other operating system.
</p>

<h2>Windows 8</h2>

<p>Windows 8 wasn't that bad, but it shipped without a real start button which made losers angry (get mad bum you propietary software using piece of shit), the biggest issue I had was with the
gestures which doesn't make sense to use with a desktop os.</p>

<p>Interestingly I think that the Windows 8 operating system was meant to be more for the phone or tablet than Desktop since Windows Phones just were coming out at the time and 
the block based desktop makes a lot of sense on mobile not on Desktop.</p>

<p>
I guess Microsoft does listen, because they dropped 8.1 which kinda brought back start button and allowed for default usage of the regular desktop with icons and what not instead of the block bullshit.
To be clear though it still is nonsense, especially the settings which would open up into a weird new agey UI or sometimes they would open up into the Control Panel. There seemed to be no rhyme
or reason for when it would be in control panel or in the new UI type of shit, and annoying the new ui windows would stay open in the background so you had to gesture close them.
</p>

<h2>Windows 10</h2>

<p>Shit literally you get ads on your homescreen. Picture being that retarded, enjoy Gates, Waz, Zuck, Jobs, Musk, and Bezos all watching you while you changes your clothes in your room or have intimate 
moments with your gay body pillow or whatever. Also, the whole free upgrade thing is stupid, its basically just market segmentation since they know must people will not have the time or effort to find product key or 
do all that nonsense, however they can still abuse and fuck the poors and stingey by giving them the free upgrade like coupon stores. So lame, You know a corporation is a fat fuck when it tries
to change prices for products to make rich people pay more and poor people pay what they can afford. One Price or go fuck yourself.
</p>

<h2>Linux is Hard? (No you are just a loser without braincells)</h2>

<p>I started using Linux exclusively in probably around 7th grade, after I first build my computer. I had windows 8 and would dual boot with Ubuntu, but started to mainly just use Ubuntu.</p>
<p>I am not a genius, it took me like a day to learn how to use Ubuntu. The hardest part about it was the installation which would not have been an issue if I did not have a stupid MOBO with UEFI nonsense.</p>
<p>However, nowadays I can not recomend Ubuntu since it sucks and snap sucks and your mom sucks. Instead it would be best to use Manjaro. I know people like to criticisize the distro, but I use
Arch and Artix (which is harder to install than Arch without Systemd). They are good operating systems, but Manjaro works much better for running Windows programs and is a lot more stable. Manjaro is also built very well for games and works out the gate for most games. (I run lol, csgo, etc. all on it fine). I would
not recommend using Arch, however. Instead use Artix, since it has a better installer and better community and doesn't use systemd which why would you use if you are going to run a custom built OS like arch/artix?
BTW Pacman is the best package manager on the planet and yay is amazing as well. Never use apt or Debian nonsense since its way more complicated and isn't as up to date.
