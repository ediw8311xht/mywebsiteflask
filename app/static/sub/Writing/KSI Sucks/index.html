<h1>KSI Sucks</h1>

<h2>KSI's Boxing Issues</h2>

<p>Knocks out Fornier with Elbow then tries to deny it, as if you can't feel your elbow hit dude?
Then he "admits" to it being an elbow after the video replay makes it abundingly clear, and people
on social media were calling him a bitch for being a bitch. However, he doesn't even apologize to dude
instead he tries to act like he is the victim because his performance was "ruined". Before the elbow 
he was hitting man on the back of the head and doing no damage, the victory was not guaranteed, and
your "performance" was shit. 
</p>

<p>All KSI does is throw looping punches that hit the fighter in the back of 
the head. KSI has shown almost no improvement after his Logan Paul fight, and whats more annoying
is that he tries to act like he is not rabbit punchign motherfuckers all the time. Like you try and clown
Pineda for being angry at you rabbit punching him all fight. I don't think you landed a single legal punch 
to his face only legal punches were to his body and all other punches were donkey punching cocoa shunter shit.
</p>

<p>KSI also disrespected Alex Wassabi by trying to claim his concussion was him trying to dodge the fight.
Its super common to get a concussion during boxing training especially if you are sparring preparing for a fight.
I think KSI must have expected him to fight through the concussion to get even more brain damage. 
I  mean just logically why would Wassabi dodge that big of a pay day and chance for views for his channel?
And Wassabi fought later against a different opponent so he can't be that he was scared.

<h2>KSI's Daddy Issues</h2>

<p>KSI was given life on a platter, growing up in a great two parent household where his parents worked
hard to pay for private school in which he flunked out of. Next thing you know KSI makes a documentary
trying to call out his dad for not being loving enough. The sentiment is fine, the conversation is fine, I don't
really care because I do not judge for personal life or whatever unless it is something crazy, but I do 
judge because he makes it public which puts negative attention on his dad and airs out public drama.
Its obvious something that should be done privately, but KSI wanted his documentary to go well so he
decides to put it all out in the open. It's also rich that KSI tries to act like the victim when his dad
put up with tons of nonsense just watch the videos his dad agrees to be a part of and hear how his dad 
worked tirelessly to afford the lifestyle KSI had when he was a kid.

<h2>KSI's (fore)Head is to Big (Massive Ego).</h2>

<p>Don't need to explain this much, guy literally put up a light with the words "legacy" on it, because
he did an interview where he said legacy was very important and what motivates him. What is your legacy bud?
Mediocre rapping, mediocre boxing, mediocre energy drink, and a great youtube career. Doing other things
semi-averagly is not going to help your legacy, its like when MJ did minor league baseball, like hurt his reputation
since he was the GOAT nba player. KSI is the GOAT british youtuber, but his rap music is ass, his energy drink is just terrible
(and embarrasing), and his boxing career is terrible as well. The sad part is that Logan Paul has the exact same legacy
just replace music with pokemon cards. Its like how every celebrity sings, acts, and dances. Like the reality is that none of that
means anything, realisticaslly what the legacy actually is just fame. You have a legacy of being a famous person.

<h2>KSI's Fans</h2>

<p><em>The man was a disgrace to boxing, they should take away his license. Fucking hell was he bad, made SPERMZ look good. It wasn't JJs fault since how could he have known. Literally during some of the interviews, the interviewers said that all the fights Pineda has been in were the kind of back-alley boxing fights. Whoever found him and actually hired Pineda needs to be fired hard.</em></p>

<p>Yeah 170 upvotes for that shit. Typical reddit comment from his retarded fans. Part of his biggest issue is his fans
are all dick riders who gas him up all the time. They just insult his forehead and other stuff for fun, but whenever its time to 
circle the wagon they are all lined up with their tongues out on two knees like fags. Btw, most of his fans are like 13 years old and 
british tardos who barely understand anything besides tea and sexually assaulting each other (look up miniminter school days stories legit admits to his friend sexually assaults a dude) </p>
