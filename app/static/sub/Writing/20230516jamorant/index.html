<h1>Idiots who are throwing a fit over Ja Morant</h1>

<p>
    Braindead losers get mad that a grown man is legally carrying a firearm in a private social media video.
</p>
<p>
    The fruitcake Richard Jefferson went on television to talk about his bullshit opinions about guns, then tried to use that opinion to attack another man.
    This moron obviously doesn't understand history, because if he did he would respect a man's right and <em>duty</em> to carry a firearm and brandish it to show that he will not be bullied by state powers or otherwise.

<p>
    This Martin Luther King Jr. wannabe must have forgotten that MLK Jr. ended up getting assasinated (Was also a rapist look it up).

<p>
    On the other hand the great devout, spiritual man known as Malcolm X used weapons to protect his community as did the Nationa of Islam he was apart of and the Black Panther group.
</p>
<p>
    I guess we should change the Disney's Black Panthers to some different name because we don't want to encourage gun use. Fucking moron, this down low brother spews his spazzy nonsense to the mass morons online and is trying to take food out of another man's mouth by calling for suspensions/ other punishments.

<h2>Express yourself how you want until the NBA doesn't approve then its "Shutup and Dribble"</h2>
<p>P.S. Kobe Bryant raped a woman and Karl Malone did too, but both never received any punishment from the NBA.</p>
<h4>Which is worse rape or posting a video legally carying a firearm on social media?</h4>
